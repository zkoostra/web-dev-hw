# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.

## Zoie Koostra

I need this class to graduate, so that's the technical reason I'm in it. In my life though, I want to be a designer for a news outlet (I'm a journalism and media arts double major) and coding and web design skills will be helpful for that. I've taken several coding classes before so I'm hoping I can use this class to challenge myself!

Here are some things I found interesting from this week:
+ There are 5 million new searches on google every day for stuff that nobody has EVER searched for before.
+ I agree that the way we interact on the internet through things like cat pictures and bad memes is an important piece of the culture of this age and can also tell us a lot about our humanity.
