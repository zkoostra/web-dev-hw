# Readme for Week of Oct. 15

### Elements
A page can only have one head and one body element. The head contains information that helps the webpage function but that is not visible to someone viewing the page, like the viewport settings, the type of HTML doc, etc. The body contains everything that a regular viewer of the page would see.

### Markup Differences
Structural markup alters the actual structure of a page, like the spacing between lines, indents etc. Semantic markup controls specific displays of text and words, for example fractions or abbreviations. Semantics means language so it's anything related to the actual "language" side communication on the page.

### Work Cycle
This work cycle I was so super late, and I'm reaaaaally sorry. I was at a journalism conference in Oregon and I just wasn't able to turn it in on time. I sincerely apologize!

The work itself was pretty easy, I found a pumpkin cake recipe and tried to use as many semantic and structural markups as I could, it maybe would have been easier to use fewer but I wanted to keep everything very consistent. I didn't really encounter any issues, honestly I find HTML so easy. That's not a brag at all, it just follows such a linear pattern of thinking compared to like, doing stuff in Creative Coding.
