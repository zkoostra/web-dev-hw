# Readme for Assignment 5: Beginning CSS

1. I chose the neon-y and geometric 80s style to work with and honestly I just googled 80's color pallettes and found an entire tumblr blog dedicated to specifically that topic so I chose a neon-ish one and went to town. I wanted to include an electric blue color too but in all honesty this assignment was completely exhausting and I had to do so much additional work to learn what to do to be able to complete it that wasn't covered in the lesson that by the time I got to this point, I was completely done.

I also wanted to use more shapes but ^ see above.

2. So the color pallete I chose was neon-ish and the colors were a lime green hue: rgba(18, 255, 120, 0.5), a lighter (not quite neon) pink,rgb(249, 181, 255); a dark purple rgb(94, 6, 232); and I wanted to include electric blue rgb(93, 222, 232); it's in my code but I didn't wind up using it for anything.

3. This work cycle was literally terrible and I am so frustrated. I feel like the lesson spent a great amount of time explaining style sheets but almost no time at all explaining how to create the shapes that you wanted us to color and decorate our page with. I was also frustrated because almost all the styling examples used text as an example but we were only required to use ONE WORD of text on our page, which indicated to me that color and shapes were our primary focus even though there were almost no examples of how to work with them.

I also feel like the teacher has not been super accessible over the semester and I would have come in for help if I felt like that was a good option or a good use of my time.
