# Readme for Assignment 2

In this class we're using GitHub as a version control system because it's a super common one and also relatively easy to use. People use VCS to stay organized and track changes they make to their work. When coding or doing web design, something you make might not work so it's helpful to be able to go back and see previous versions of your work in case something gets broken.

Honestly I found this cycle to be really boring and frustrating. I already had GitHub set up from previous classes I've taken and the most difficult part of the assignments was already knowing what to do but still having to read all of the instructions in order to do what the assignment required exactly. So in short, I really just followed instructions. I'm ready to start some of my own work!
