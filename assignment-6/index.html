    <div class="body">
      <p>This book contains thirty stories about the children and teachers at Wayside School. But before we get to them, there is something you ought to know so that you donâ€™t get confused.
        Wayside School was accidentally built sideways.</p>

      <p>It was supposed to be only one story high, with thirty classrooms all in a row. Instead it is thirty stories high, with one classroom on each story. The builder said he was very sorry.</p>

      <p>The children at Wayside like having a sideways school. They have an extra-large playground.
        The children and teachers described in this book all go to class on the top floor. So there are thirty stories from the thirtieth story of Wayside School.</p>

      <p>It has been said that these stories are strange and silly. That is probably true. However, when I told stories about you to the children at Wayside, they thought you were strange and silly.</p>

      <p>That is probably also true.</p>
