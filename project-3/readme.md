# Project 3 Readme

1. Borders are a visual tool rather than a spacial tool. Borders can be colored and they can be solid, dotted, dashed etc, for visual effects. Margins control how much space goes between the borders of a box and other elements on the outside of those borders. Padding controls how much space there is between the contents of the box and the border.

2. The hardest part of this assignment for me was matching up the classes I needed to make styles with what I was actually putting in the HTML. I looked at the example really heavily to be able to decide what kinds of things I needed to add to my code. I haven't figured out if it's easier to make the html first and then style it or create the styles before and use it to structure what I put on my page.

3.I decided to imitate my real personal website by using the same photo and red serif text as the main features. This project came a lot ea sier to me than the previous two assignments. I looked a lot to the example that was shared for how I structured my styles section. Honestly I really wish we'd had this lesson before the previous two assignments. I feel like learning boxes and the concepts of layout as our first lesson with css would have made a lot more sense than the order we did it in and now I'm wishing I could go back and do those assignments again with the knowledge I have now.
